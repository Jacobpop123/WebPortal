            <h2>The Myth of Prometheus</h2>
            <p>Prometheus, a Titan known for his empathy and wisdom, is credited with creating humans out of clay. Acknowledging that humanity lacked the essential tools for survival, he gifted them fire, a symbol of knowledge and progress. This fire was stolen from the gods, hiding it inside a stalk of fennel to keep it concealed.
            This act angered Zeus, taking this as a challenge of authority and act of disobedience. Therefore, as punishment, Zeus had Prometheus bound to a mountain in the Caucasus, where every day an eagle would feast on his regenerating liver. Because Prometheus was immortal, his liver would grow back each night, making his punishment endless.
            Prometheus endured this suffering for many years, until Herakles (Hercules), as part of his Twelve Labors, freed him, ending his torment.
